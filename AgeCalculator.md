 **Date Object and Date Methods:**
    - `new Date()`, `getYear()`, `getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()` are all related to JavaScript's `Date` object, which is used for handling dates and times.
    - `new Date()` creates a new instance of the `Date` object representing the current date and time.
    - `getFullYear()` returns the year of the date.
    - `getMonth()` returns the month of the date (0-11, where 0 is January).
    - `getDate()` returns the day of the month (1-31).
   
   **Example:**
   ```javascript
   const currentDate = new Date();
   const currentYear = currentDate.getFullYear();
   const currentMonth = currentDate.getMonth(); // 0 represents January
   const currentDay = currentDate.getDate();
   ```



### First Conditional Block

```javascript
if (months < 0 || (months === 0 && days < 0)) {
  years--;
  months += 12;
}
```

This block checks two conditions:

1. `months < 0`: Whether the birth month has not yet occurred this year.
2. `months === 0 && days < 0`: Whether the birth month is this month but the birth day has not yet occurred.

In either case, the `years` are reduced by `1` because the birthday for the current year hasn't happened yet. To balance out this reduction in `years`, `12` months are added to `months`.

For example, if today is March 15, 2023, and the birth date is December 5, 2000:

- `months` would initially be `-9` (March - December)
- The condition `months < 0` would be `true`
- `years` would be decremented by `1`, effectively making the age `22` years instead of `23`
- `months` would be incremented by `12`, making it `3` (March to June)

### Second Conditional Block

```javascript
if (days < 0) {
  months--;
  days += new Date(today.getFullYear(), today.getMonth(), 0).getDate();
}
```

Here, `days < 0` checks whether the birth day has not occurred yet for the current month.

1. If `days` is negative, it means the birthday hasn't occurred for the current month. Thus, `months` is decremented by `1`.
2. The `days` variable is incremented by the total number of days in the *previous month*, essentially setting it to the number of days left for the birthday to occur this month.

For instance, if today is March 10, 2023, and the birth date is March 20, 2000:

- `days` would initially be `-10` (10 - 20)
- `months` would be decremented by `1`
- The total number of days in February 2023 (28, since 2023 is not a leap year) would be added to `days`, making it `18`.

### Summary

These conditional blocks aim to correct the initial calculations of `years`, `months`, and `days` to ensure they accurately represent the time elapsed since the given `birthday`. Both are essentially handling edge cases to ensure that you're not counting a year or a month that hasn't fully occurred yet based on the birth date.
